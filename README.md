## Description
The objective was to update the version one of the portfolio with the new tools that we have learned. This is a good practice on how to put together the skills and promote our work.

As the objective was to have a neat presentation and a mobile first design, I chose to work with the materialize CSS framework because I like their design for cards and the navbar transformation into a side bar when seen in mobile.

Also, for the projects section I put my first collaboration project and the teammates, also 2 personal projects that I felt proud to show.

## Thanks
